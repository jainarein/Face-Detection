# 👀 Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This is a simple **real-time face detection app** built using Python and OpenCV.  
It uses a Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces from your webcam and highlights them with green rectangles.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Detects faces in real-time
- 🎥 Uses your webcam feed
- 🟩 Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
- 🧠 Beginner-friendly OpenCV project
